> There’s little doubt that Grace is the best freeware sampler on today’s VST plugin market. [...] It is a stable and compact sampler with a great streamlined workflow and a strong feature set.  It’s the sampler that you’ll think of first when you need to import some of your samples into a project. Some users will be turned off by the lack of round robin support, however Grace will be more than capable of completing the majority of common sampling tasks. This virtual instrument is a wonderful gift for the freeware community and we can’t thank One Small Clue enough for it!
