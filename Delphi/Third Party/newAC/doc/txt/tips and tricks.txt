Section: Snippets
	Bits of code to do things related to NewAC.


Topic: How to make an indicator component more responsive
	When constructing an audio-processing chain always try to place an indicator component as close to the audio input/output component as possible. It should be the first component after AudioIn or the last componentbefore AudioOut.


Topic: What to do if an input component reports premature end of data
	One possible reason for this may be an exception raised during components' operation. Don't forget to set the OnThreadException event handler and inspect an output component's ExceptionMessage property.

Topic: How to decrease the delay before audio playback
	The TDXAudioOut component buffers its output in order to make it smoother. This
	buffering introduces some delay at the beginning of audio playback.

	You can decrease the delay by decreasing the size of the TDXAudioOut buffer.
	The size of this buffer is set up by the <DS_BUFFER_SIZE> constant in
	ACS_DxAudio.pas.
	
	If you decrease the buffer size you may also want to decrease the
	<DS_POLLING_INTERVAL> value which determines how often the component requests
	data from its input.

Topic: How not to crash or hang when exiting an application
If you exit a NewAC application while it is playing without stopping it, it
may crash or hang. To prevent this, provide an OnClose event handler for the
form where NewAC components reside. In this hander call Stop methods for all
output components. A typical OnClose handler might look like this.

(code)
procedure TForm1.FormClose(Sender: TObject; var Action: TCloseAction);
begin
  DXAudioOut1.Stop(False);
end;
(end)

You pass Stop a False value if you are closing an application and don't want
any events. Remember that it is not harmful to call Stop even when the output
component is idle.

Topic: Create Class Based on Filename
	These functions create a TAuFile component of a class based on the file extension of a filename.
